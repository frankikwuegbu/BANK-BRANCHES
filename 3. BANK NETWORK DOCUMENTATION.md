**DOCUMENTATION**

**OBJECTIVES**  
The goal of this project is to build a simple network for a bank headquarter and its branch using packet tracer. Both networks should have redundancy, security measures and dynamic protocols across the network to enhance network efficiency. The protocols configured show proficiency in the CLI of Cisco devices and the overall project provides a snapshot of my understanding of key concepts in preparation for the CCNA.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**  
**HEAD-QUARTER**  
The bank's headquarter network contains various protocols all implemented to enhance the network experience. The protocols implemented on the headquarter networks include: R-PVST+, DHCP Snooping, OSPF, ACL, DHCP, FHRP, and more. The details of the protocols will be given later on.  
The various departments in the bank (teller, customer service, IT, etc.) are assigned their own VLAN in the network and as such traffic flow between departments can be controlled.  
Ultimately the headquarters' network is set up so that access to the default gate is always maintained by implementing redundancy in layer 2 and access to the outside network is also a given, this time due to a combination of protocols.

**IP ADDRESSING SCHEME AND STANDARD**

To maintain consistency across the network a fixed subnet mask was assigned to all VLANs in the network.  
The headquarters' branch was assigned the 192.168.1.0/24 private network, and all VLANS in the network used the /28 subnet.  
Using fixed length subnets over a variable length subnet mask (VLSM) helps for troubleshooting scenarios. It also makes it easier to communicate the project between different members if need be. The decision to use fixed subnet masks was settled on when I confirmed that running out of the assigned IP address will not be an issue.

**VIRTUAL LANs (VLAN)**  
The bank's headquarter contained six (6) departments all virtually separated using VLANs. This virtual separation not only helps restrict broadcast messages to the intended department but can be used to control traffic between departments if needed. This is done using Access Control List (ACL) which will be discussed later.  
But there is more. The server which facilitates DNS in the bank network has its own VLAN, also, management VLANs were created for the two layer 2 switches in the topology. These management VLANs are used to allow for remote access to the respective devices using SSH, another protocol which will be discussed later.  
\! The management VLANs were assigned IP addresses (10.10.10.0/28 & 10.10.20.0/28) separate from the networks private IP (192.168.1.0/24)

**PROTOCOLS**  
This section of the documentation looks to highlight the configured protocols on our network. Details and context will be provided for some of these concepts and the commands applied to implement them will be made available in a separate folder.

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: The STP is a protocol which is implemented to enforce layer 2 redundancy. It does this by blocking redundant ports in a collision domain. This blockage prevents loops which when they occur and left unattended can lead to a broadcast storm. Thus, blocking the requisite ports helps stop this while providing multiple paths for traffic flow within the network.  
Cisco has a proprietary version of the rapid spanning tree called Rapid Per-Vlan Spanning Tree (R-PVST+). This allows for different switches to be configured as the primary/root bridge for every instance of a VLAN and thus ensuring that one port doesn't remain in the blocking state perpetually.  
\! R-PVST+ was the spanning tree protocol of choice for this project to help with load management and improve the overall network experience.

**VLANS AND THEIR PRIMARY BRIDGES**

VLAN 20  \- MLSW1  
VLAN 30  \- MLSW1  
VLAN 40  \- MLSW2  
VLAN 50  \- SW2  
VLAN 60  \- MLSW2  
VLAN 70  \- MLSW2  
VLAN 100 \- SW1  
VLAN 200 \- SW2  
   
**First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)**: continuing on the theme of redundancy, FHRP is a protocol which is used to ensure redundancy in layer 3 (i.e. routers). Doing this ensures that access to the outside network is maintained even if failure to one router occurs. This is done by configuring a Virtual IP (VIP) to the redundant routers. They elect an active router among themselves mostly according to the value of priority. The active router functions as the sole default gate of the network and should the active router be switched off or damaged, then the standby router takes over.

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: This is a protocol which dynamically assigns IP configurations to hosts in a network. This is obviously easier than manually assigning these configurations to every PC in a large network. Configuring this protocol involves excluding addresses and configuring a pool which holds the necessary IP configurations which include, default gateway address, DNS server address, domain name and IP address.

**DHCP Snooping**:  This is a security protocol configured to filter DHCP client messages received on untrusted ports. This filtering process helps ensure that these messages are not originating from malicious hosts. In addition, DHCP rate limiting can be configured to control the rate at which these DHCP messages are allowed which helps prevent DHCP based attacks.

**Some of the other protocols implemented in this project includes**:  
\- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)  
\- Access Control List (ACL)  
\- Domain Name System (DNS)  
\- Network Address Translation (NAT)  
\- Secure Shell (SSH)
